# Overview

These are the features and documentation that I know are missing and plan to add as I prioritize them. No set timelines and this list is not for priority

# Documentation

- Command outputs
- GUI install steps for VM
- `virsh` install commands

# Features
- bash scripts for installation
- ansible roles
- `.desktop` file creation
- `virt-manager` without `sudo` or `root` access
